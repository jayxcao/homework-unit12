In this assignment we will build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk using data you'd typically see from peer-to-peer lending services. Credit risk is an inherently imbalanced classification problem (the number of good loans is much larger than the number of at-risk loans), so we will need to employ different techniques for training and evaluating models with imbalanced classes. You will use the imbalanced-learn and Scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using the two following techniques:

1. Resampling
2. Ensemble Learning

## Machine Learning - Resampling

> **Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?**

Under Sampling produced 0.9956813049736126

> **Which model had the best recall score?**

Under Sampling produced 0.994635 recall

> **Which model had the best geometric mean score?**

Combination Sampling had the best Geometric Mean Score 0.995681




## Mahcine Learning - Ensemble Learning


> **Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?**

1. Easy Ensemble Classifier produced an accuracy score of: 0.9139038962817925

> **Which model had the best recall score?**

2. Easy Ensemble Classifier produced recall of 0.942459


> **Which model had the best geometric mean score?**

3. Easy Ensemble Classsifer had the best geometric mean score of: 0.913449


> **What are the top three features?**

4. Top 3 features :[(0.08381390669944408, 'total_rec_prncp'), (0.0647577823734246, 'last_pymnt_amnt'), (0.05718199030904339, 'total_pymnt_inv')]
